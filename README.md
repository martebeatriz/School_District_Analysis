# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards. Our job is replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. We then replaced the math and reading scores, and repeated the school district analysis.


## Results: 

### District Summary Affect 

The difference in the data was only slight. After the 9th graders in Thomas High School were removed, the scores did see a slight decrease in scores but no more than 0.3 in difference. See images below:

## Thomas High School's performance 
After the contested results of the ninth graders' math and reading scores were removed, Thomas High Schools' performance numbers were nearly unchanged. Even though the math, reading, and overall scores went down, the only went down by less than one percent. Therefore, it's standing amoungst the other schools was unchanged. 

The updated data shows Thomas High School as the second best performing school.
